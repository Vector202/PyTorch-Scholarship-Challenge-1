# PyTorch-Scholarship-Challenge

## Day 1 | Course Introduction
Learned Classification Problem, Linear Boundaries, Higher Boundaries and Perceptron. Perceptron is pretty amazing it worked same as a Neuron.

## Day 2 | Entropy
Learned Error Function, Log-Loss Error Function and cross entropy. Among these cross entropy is the best way to get prediction.
