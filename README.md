# PyTorch-Scholarship-Challenge

## Day 1 | Course Introduction
Learned Classification Problem, Linear Boundaries, Higher Boundaries and Perceptron. Perceptron is pretty amazing it worked same as a Neuron.

## Day 2 | Entropy
Learned Error Function, Log-Loss Error Function and cross entropy. Among these cross entropy is the best way to get prediction.

## Day 3 | Gradient Descent
Learned about gradient Descent and continuous perceptron. Ipython Notebook [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/souvikb07/PyTorch-Scholarship-Challenge/blob/master/Lesson_2/GradientDescent.ipynb)

## Day 4 | First Neural Network
Learned about the Neural Network Architure, Backpropogation, made my first neural network, Regularization and different activation function. The thing about neural network is that it is a combination of linear models and the maths behind every function is beautiful.

## Day 5 | Neural Network using Pytorch
Build a neural network using Pytorch.

## Day 6 | Neural Network Architectures
Build Neural Network Architecture and trained the model. Ipython notebook for [Neural Network](https://github.com/souvikb07/PyTorch-Scholarship-Challenge/blob/master/Lesson_4/Part%202%20-%20Neural%20Networks%20in%20PyTorch.ipynb) and [Training Neural Networks.](https://github.com/souvikb07/PyTorch-Scholarship-Challenge/blob/master/Lesson_4/Part%203%20-%20Training%20Neural%20Networks.ipynb)

## Day 7 | Classifying Fashion MNIST

## Day 8 | Dogs vs Cats
