# PyTorch-Scholarship-Challenge

## Day 1 | Course Introduction
Learned Classification Problem, Linear Boundaries, Higher Boundaries and Perceptron. Perceptron is pretty amazing it worked same as a Neuron.

## Day 2 | Entropy
Learned Error Function, Log-Loss Error Function and cross entropy. Among these cross entropy is the best way to get prediction.

## Day 3 | Gradient Descent
Learned about gradient Descent and continuous perceptron. Ipython Notebook [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/souvikb07/PyTorch-Scholarship-Challenge/blob/master/Lesson_2/GradientDescent.ipynb)

## Day 4 | First Neural Network
Learned about the Neural Network Architure, Backpropogation, made my first neural network, Regularization and different activation function. The thing about neural network is that it is a combination of linear models and the maths behind every function is beautiful.

## Day 5 | Neural Network using Pytorch
Build a neural network using Pytorch.

## Day 6 | Neural Network Architectures
Build Neural Network Architecture and trained the model.

## Day 7 | Classifying Fashion MNIST
Build a simple Neural Network from scratch to detect the type of clothes. I got to know that with very simple model you can also get goot accuracy.

## Day 8 | Dogs vs Cats
Build a simple Neural Network from scratch to detect that the image is of cat or dog. Learned about Inference and Validation and how to save and load a trained model. Also learned how to load image files on pytorch. 
Ipython Notebook of [Dogs vs Cats](https://github.com/souvikb07/PyTorch-Scholarship-Challenge/blob/master/Lesson_4/Part%206%20-%20Saving%20and%20Loading%20Models.ipynb), [Inference and Validation](https://github.com/souvikb07/PyTorch-Scholarship-Challenge/blob/master/Lesson_4/Part%205%20-%20Inference%20and%20Validation.ipynb), [Loadig Image Data.](https://github.com/souvikb07/PyTorch-Scholarship-Challenge/blob/master/Lesson_4/Part%207%20-%20Loading%20Image%20Data.ipynb)

## Day 9 | Transfer Learning
Learned how to use pre-trained networks to solved challenging problems in computer vision. Used *densenet121* model to train a model to find the difference between a cat and a dog. Ipython Notebook of [Transfer Learning.](https://github.com/souvikb07/PyTorch-Scholarship-Challenge/blob/master/Lesson_4/Part_8_Transfer_Learning.ipynb)

## Day 10 | MLP Classification
Build a model to recognise numbers using MLP Classification.
IPython Notebook of [MLP](https://github.com/souvikb07/PyTorch-Scholarship-Challenge/blob/master/Lesson_5/mnist_mlp.ipynb)

## Day 11 | MLP with validation
Build MLP with validation, learned about local connectivity, filters and the convolutional layer.
